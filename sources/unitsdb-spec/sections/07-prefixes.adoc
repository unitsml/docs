== Prefix

=== General

A prefix is a modifier that, when attached to a unit, multiplies that unit by a
specified factor.

In UnitsDB, prefixes are used to create multiples and submultiples of units,
allowing for the expression of quantities across a wide range of magnitudes.

=== Prefix model

==== Definition

The Prefix model is defined as follows.

[source,lutaml]
----
class Prefix {
  attribute id, String {
    definition "Unique identifier for the prefix"
  }
  attribute name, String {
    definition "Name of the prefix (e.g., kilo, milli)"
  }
  attribute symbol, PrefixSymbols {
    definition "Symbol representations in different formats"
  }
  attribute base, Integer {
    definition "The base of the exponentiation (10 for SI prefixes, 2 for binary prefixes)"
  }
  attribute power, Integer {
    definition "The power to which the base is raised"
  }
}
----

==== YAML structure

The prefix data is stored in the `prefixes.yaml` file with the following structure:

[source,yaml]
----
NISTp10_3:
  name: kilo
  symbol:
    ascii: k
    html: k
    latex: k
    unicode: k
  base: 10
  power: 3

NISTp10_-6:
  name: micro
  symbol:
    ascii: u
    html: "&micro;"
    latex: "$mu$"
    unicode: Î¼
  base: 10
  power: -6

NISTp2_10:
  name: kibi
  symbol:
    ascii: Ki
    html: Ki
    latex: Ki
    unicode: Ki
  base: 2
  power: 10
----

==== Attributes

===== id

The `id` field is a unique identifier for the prefix. The format follows a pattern of "NISTp" followed by the base and power of the prefix, separated by an underscore. For SI prefixes, the format is "NISTp10_X" where X is the power, which can be positive or negative. For binary prefixes, the format is "NISTp2_X".

===== name

The `name` field contains the name of the prefix, such as "kilo", "milli", or "giga".

===== symbol

The `symbol` field contains representations of the prefix symbol in different formats using the `PrefixSymbols` model.

===== base

The `base` field indicates the base of the exponentiation.

* For SI prefixes, this is always 10.
* For binary prefixes, it is 2.

===== power

The `power` field indicates the power to which the base is raised to obtain the multiplier for the prefix.

For example, a power of 3 with a base of 10 gives a multiplier of 10^3^ = 1000.

=== Prefix symbols model

==== Definition

[source,lutaml]
----
class PrefixSymbols {
  attribute ascii, String {
    definition "ASCII text representation"
  }
  attribute html, String {
    definition "HTML representation (may include HTML entities)"
  }
  attribute mathml, String {
    definition "MathML representation in XML format."
  }
  attribute latex, String {
    definition "LaTeX representation in LaTeX typeset format."
  }
  attribute unicode, String {
    definition "Unicode representation in UTF-8 encoding."
  }
}
----

==== Attributes

===== ascii

The `ascii` field contains the ASCII text representation of the prefix symbol.
This is the most basic representation and is suitable for plain text environments.

===== html

The `html` field contains the HTML representation of the prefix symbol.
This may include HTML entities for special characters.

===== mathml

The `mathml` field contains the MathML representation of the prefix symbol
and is a MathML string.
This is for use within MathML-supported environments.

===== latex

The `latex` field contains the LaTeX representation of the prefix symbol.
This is for use within LaTeX documents or LaTeX-supported environments.

===== unicode

The `unicode` field contains the Unicode representation of the prefix symbol.
This is mainly for use within UnicodeMath or other Unicode-enabled environments.

NOTE: This allows for the representation of characters that may not be available
in ASCII or HTML.
