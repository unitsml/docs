== Dimension

=== General

A dimension is a physical quantity that can be measured.

According to the SI Brochure, a dimension is defined as "a physical quantity
that can be expressed in terms of base quantities." Dimensions are fundamental
to the system of units and provide a framework for understanding and comparing
different physical properties.

The SI standard defines the following dimensions and corresponding dimension symbols:

* time (T)
* length (L)
* mass (M)
* electric current (I)
* absolute temperature (Î˜)
* amount of substance (N)
* luminous intensity (J).

In UnitsDB, dimensions are represented as mathematical combinations of base
dimensions, using the same approach as dimensional analysis in physics.


=== Dimension model

==== Definition

The Dimension model is defined as follows.

[source,lutaml]
----
class Dimension {
  attribute id, String {
    definition {
      Unique identifier for the dimension
    }
  }

  attribute dimensionless, Boolean {
    definition {
      Whether the dimension is dimensionless. A dimensionless dimension
      does not have any associated dimension components in `components`.
    }
  }

  attribute components, DimensionComponent {
    collection true
    definition {
      Components of the dimension, including base quantities and their powers.
      Not applicable for dimensionless quantities.
    }
  }
}
----

==== YAML structure

The dimension data is stored in the `dimensions.yaml` file with the following structure:

[source,yaml]
----
NISTd1:
  length:
    powerNumerator: 1
    symbol: L
    dim_symbols:
    - id: dim_L
      ascii: L
      html: "&#x1D5AB;"
      mathml: "<mi mathvariant='sans-serif'>L</mi>"
      latex: "\\ensuremath{\\mathsf{L}}"
      unicode: "\U0001D5AB"

    powerNumerator: 1
    symbol: M

==== Attributes

===== id

The `id` field is a unique identifier for the dimension, typically in the format
`NISTdX` where X is a number. Each dimension has a unique ID that is used for
cross-referencing throughout the UnitsDB system.

===== dimensionless

The `dimensionless` field is a boolean that indicates whether the dimension is
dimensionless (true) or has a physical dimension (false or not present).
Dimensionless quantities are pure numbers without units, such as ratios, angles,
and counts.

===== dimension components

Each dimension is composed of one or more base dimension components represented as a DimensionComponent object.

Each dimension can only have a maximum of one base dimension component of each
type of the 7 base dimensions.


=== Dimension component model

==== General

A dimension component represents a base quantity and its exponent (power) in the dimension.

The seven base quantities in SI are:

* (NISTq1) length
* (NISTq2) mass
* (NISTq3) time
* (NISTq4) electric current
* (NISTq5) thermodynamic temperature
* (NISTq6) amount of substance
* (NISTq7) luminous intensity

class DimensionComponent {
  attribute base_dimension, BaseDimensionEnum {
    definition {
      The base dimension represented by this component.
    }
  }

  attribute power_numerator, Integer {
    definition "The exponent (power) of the base quantity in the dimension"
  }

  attribute symbol, String {
    definition "The symbol used to represent the base quantity in dimensional formulas"
  }

  attribute dim_symbols, DimensionSymbol {
    collection true
    definition "Symbol representations in different formats"
  }
}

----

==== Attributes

===== base_dimension

The `base_dimension` field is an enumeration that specifies the base dimension
represented by this component, with possible values listed in the
`BaseDimensionEnum` model.

===== power_numerator

The `power_numerator` field is an integer that represents the exponent (power)
of the base quantity in the dimension. This indicates how many times the base
dimension is multiplied in the dimension formula.

[example]
A power of 2 indicates that the base dimension is squared.

[example]
For a dimension with a power of -1, it indicates the reciprocal of the base dimension.

===== symbol

The `symbol` field represents a general notation used for the dimension in various contexts.

[example]
For a dimension expressed with a power of 0, it indicates that the dimension is dimensionless.

===== dim_symbols

The `dim_symbols` field is a collection of `DimensionSymbol` objects that
represent the symbol representations of the dimension in different formats, in
the `DimensionSymbol` model.


=== Base dimension enumeration

==== General

The `BaseDimensionEnum` model defines the enumeration of base dimensions
according to the SI system. Each base dimension is represented by a unique
identifier and has a corresponding definition.


==== Definition

class BaseDimensionEnum {
  definition {

  }

  value length {
    definition {
      The base dimension of length
    }

  value plane_angle {
    definition {
      The base dimension of the dimensionless plane angle. This is a special
      case that is not a base dimension in the SI system but is often treated as
      such in dimensional analysis.

=== Dimension representation symbol model

==== General

The dimension representation symbols model defines the various symbol
representations for a dimension. These symbols are used in different contexts,
such as mathematical expressions, HTML rendering, and LaTeX typesetting.

This model is only used for base dimensions defined in the `BaseDimensionEnum` model.

NOTE: Only base dimensions have officially assigned dimension symbols by the SI System.
