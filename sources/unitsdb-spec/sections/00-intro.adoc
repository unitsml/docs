== Introduction

UnitsDB is a comprehensive database of units of measurement, quantities,
dimensions, and prefixes that serves as the authoritative reference for the
UnitsML framework.

UnitsDB provides a structured and standardized way to represent and reference
measurement units and related concepts across various scientific, engineering,
and technical domains.

UnitsDB is designed to support multiple applications, including:

* Providing an authoritative source of measurement units for scientific and technical documentation
* Supporting unit conversion systems
* Enabling semantic interoperability between different systems that work with measurement data

This specification defines the data models, structures, and normalization rules
for UnitsDB. It is intended for developers implementing UnitsML, database
administrators managing UnitsDB installations, and contributors who wish to
extend or modify the database.

By following this specification, implementers and users of UnitsDB can ensure
consistent and accurate representation of measurement units and related concepts
across different applications and domains.
