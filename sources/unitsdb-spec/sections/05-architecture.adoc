== Architecture

=== General

The UnitsDB architecture follows a modular design that organizes
measurement-related concepts into distinct but interconnected data models. These
data models are implemented as YAML files, with each file focusing on a specific
aspect of the measurement system.

This section describes the overall architecture, the relationships between
different entities, and how the lutaml-model language is used to define the data
models.

=== File organization

UnitsDB is organized into five primary YAML files, each responsible for a different component of the measurement system:


*`dimensions.yaml`::
Contains definitions of physical dimensions (length, mass, time, etc.)

*`quantities.yaml`::
Contains definitions of measurable quantities (length, velocity, force, etc.)

*`units.yaml`::
Contains definitions of measurement units (meter, second, newton, etc.)

*`prefixes.yaml`::
Contains definitions of unit prefixes (kilo, milli, mega, etc.)

*`unit_systems.yaml`::
Contains definitions of unit systems (SI, non-SI) and their categories

Each file contains entries that follow a consistent model structure as defined using the lutaml-model language.

=== Entity relationships

The UnitsDB architecture establishes explicit relationships between different entities to create a coherent measurement system:

                                 | UnitSystem  |<--------+
                                 +-------------+         |
                                                         |
                   +-----------+                         |
                   |           |                         |
  +------------+   | Dimension |  +----------+           |
  |   Prefix   |   |           |  | Quantity |           |
  +------------+   +-----------+  +----------+           |
         |               ^             ^                 |
         |               |             |                 |
         v               |             |                 |
  +----------------------------------------------------------------+
  |                             Unit                               |
  +----------------------------------------------------------------+
----

The key relationships are:

* Dimension ↔ Quantity: Each quantity has exactly one dimension, but multiple quantities can share the same dimension
* Quantity ↔ Unit: Each quantity can be measured by multiple units, and each unit can measure multiple quantities (many-to-many relationship)
* Unit ↔ Dimension: Each unit has exactly one dimension, which must match the dimension of the quantities it measures
* Prefix ↔ Unit: Prefixes can be applied to units to create new prefixed units
* UnitSystem ↔ Unit: Each unit belongs to a specific unit system

These relationships are implemented through cross-references between the different YAML files.

=== Cross-reference mechanism

UnitsDB uses a consistent cross-reference mechanism to link entities across different files:

* References to dimensions use the format `#NISTdX` (e.g., `#NISTd1` for length)
* References to quantities use the format `#NISTqX` (e.g., `#NISTq1` for length)
* References to units use the format `#NISTuX` (e.g., `#NISTu1` for meter)
* References to prefixes use the format `#NISTpX_Y` (e.g., `#NISTp10_3` for kilo)

These cross-references create a web of relationships that maintain the integrity and coherence of the measurement system.

=== Lutaml-model language

UnitsDB uses the lutaml-model language to define the structure of each data model. The lutaml-model language provides a human-readable way to define class-like structures with attributes and relationships.

The general pattern for a lutaml-model class definition is:

[source,lutaml]
----
class ClassName {
  attribute attributeName, AttributeType {
    definition "Description of the attribute"
  }
  // Additional attributes...
}
----

UnitsDB defines five primary classes using lutaml-model:

* `Dimension`: Represents the mathematical concept of a physical dimension
* `Quantity`: Represents a measurable property with a specific dimension
* `Unit`: Represents a reference for measuring quantities
* `Prefix`: Represents a multiplier for units
* `UnitSystem`: Represents a system of units (e.g., SI, non-SI)

Each class definition specifies the attributes that should be present in the corresponding YAML files.

=== Inheritance hierarchies

UnitsDB does not use formal inheritance hierarchies, but it does establish conceptual hierarchies through relationships:

* Base dimensions vs. derived dimensions: Derived dimensions are composed of combinations of base dimensions
* Base quantities vs. derived quantities: Derived quantities reference dimensions that are combinations of base dimensions
* Base units vs. derived units: Derived units are composed of combinations of base units

These hierarchies are reflected in the data structure rather than through formal inheritance mechanisms.

=== Extension points

The UnitsDB architecture includes several extension points for future development:

* Addition of new dimensions, quantities, units, prefixes, or unit systems
* Enhancement of metadata for existing entities
* Addition of conversion factors between units with the same dimension
* Extension of symbol representations to support additional formats
* Domain-specific annotations for specialized fields

These extension points allow UnitsDB to evolve while maintaining backward compatibility.

=== Model mapping to YAML

The lutaml-model class definitions are mapped to YAML structures in the database files. For example, the `Unit` class defined in lutaml-model:

[source,lutaml]
----
class Unit {
  attribute id, String {
    definition "Unique identifier for the unit"
  }
  attribute dimension_url, String {
    definition "Reference to the dimension of the unit"
  }
  // Additional attributes...
}
----

Maps to YAML entries like:

[source,yaml]
----
NISTu1:
  dimension_url: "#NISTd1"
  short: meter
  # Additional properties...
----

This mapping ensures that the YAML files conform to the defined data models while maintaining human readability.

=== Implementation considerations

When implementing UnitsDB for specific applications, several architectural considerations are important:

* YAML parsing: Implementations should handle YAML 1.2 syntax correctly
* Cross-reference resolution: Applications need to resolve references between entities
* Validation: Implementations should validate entries against the defined models
* Memory management: Depending on the application, different caching strategies may be appropriate
* Query capabilities: Applications might need to support various ways to search and retrieve entities

These considerations influence how UnitsDB is integrated into larger systems and applications.
