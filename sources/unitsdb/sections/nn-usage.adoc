=== Quantity usage models

==== General

The quantity usage models describe how quantities are used in practical applications.

==== Finding units for a quantity

To find all units that can measure a specific quantity, you can look up the quantity's `unit_reference` field. For example, to find units for measuring velocity (NISTq12):

[source,yaml]
----
NISTq12:
  unit_reference:
  - name: meter per second
    url: "#NISTu1.u3e-1/1"
  - name: kilometer per hour
    url: "#NISTu160"
  - name: mile per hour
    url: "#NISTu110"
  # ...and more
----

==== Finding quantities with the same dimension

To find all quantities that share the same dimension, you can search for quantities with matching `dimension_url` values. For example, quantities with dimension "L" (NISTd1) include:

* length (NISTq1)
* distance (NISTq48)
* radius (NISTq98)
* height (NISTq96)
* thickness (NISTq97)

==== Unit conversion for a quantity

Once you identify that two units can measure the same quantity (they appear in the same quantity's `unit_reference` list), you can use conversion factors to convert measurements between them.

[example]
====
For the quantity "length" (NISTq1), to convert between meter (NISTu1) and foot (NISTu78):
1 meter = 3.28084 feet
====

This dimensional analysis approach ensures that conversions are physically meaningful and that the resulting measurements represent the same physical quantity.
