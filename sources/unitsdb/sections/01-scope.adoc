== Scope

This document specifies the data models, structures, and normalization rules for
UnitsDB, the authoritative database of measurement units, quantities,
dimensions, and prefixes for the UnitsML framework.

NOTE: This document applies to UnitsDB version 1.0.0.

The specification defines:

* The overall architecture of UnitsDB
* The data models for unit systems, prefixes, quantities, dimensions, and units
* The format and structure of YAML files that comprise the database
* The normalization rules for data integrity and consistency
* The relationships between different entities in the database
* A test suite for validation of UnitsDB implementations

This document:

* Does not specify implementation details for using UnitsDB in applications
* Does not define algorithms for unit conversions or dimensional analysis (though the data provided supports these operations)
* Does not provide a comprehensive list of all units, quantities, dimensions, and prefixes (these are provided in the actual database)

This specification is intended for:

* Developers implementing UnitsML systems
* Developers managing UnitsDB database instances
* Contributors extending or modifying the UnitsDB database
* Standards developers referencing UnitsDB

The specification enables interoperable representation of measurement units and
related concepts across different applications, domains, and systems.
