== Principles

=== General

The design and architecture of the UnitsDB adheres to the following
principles.

* Scientific accuracy and completeness
* Interoperability
* Declarative content
* Ease of use and maintenance
* Extensibility

=== Scientific accuracy and completeness

UnitsDB adheres to the International System of Units (SI) and
aims to facilitate accurate measurement across various domains
towards international standards.

The database aims to accurately represent:

* Base and derived units as defined by SI.
* Information models used in the representation and realization of a digital
units system.
* Historical and non-SI units that are still in use.

=== Interoperability

UnitsDB supports interoperability through:

* Simple realization of the database in human-readable formats
* Globally unique identifiers
* Support for presentational needs of units
* Well-defined data models allowing straightforward serialization to various
formats

=== Declarative content

UnitsDB maintains structural consistency through:

* Well-defined data models for each entity type
* Separation of concerns in information models
* Explicit definitions of relationships between information models

=== Ease of use and maintenance

UnitsDB applies data normalization principles to:

* Eliminate redundancy in the database
* Ensure data integrity across related entities
* Simplify maintenance and updates
* Support efficient querying and processing
* Enable validation and consistency checking


=== Interoperability

UnitsDB supports interoperability through:

* Use of industry-standard YAML for data representation
* Clear separation of content from presentation
* Consistent identifiers and cross-references
* Support for multiple symbol representations (ASCII, Unicode, MathML, LaTeX, HTML)
* Well-defined data models that can be mapped to various implementation formats

This interoperability enables UnitsDB to serve as a reference database for diverse applications and systems.

=== Ease of use and maintenance

UnitsDB aims to provide users an easy to use information database while keeping
it easy and simple to maintain.

* Human-readable content facilitates inspection and understanding by humans and transparent review and validation of content
* Automated validation and consistency checking
* Allows incofmproation into software sytsemss
* Efficient querying and filtering
* Transformation to other formats and representations


=== Extensibility

UnitsDB is designed to be extensible to accommodate:

* New units as they are defined, come into use or encoded historically
* Additional quantities in emerging domains
* New prefixes defined in the future
* Domain-specific extensions and annotations
