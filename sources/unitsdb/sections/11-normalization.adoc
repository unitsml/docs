== Data file normalization rules

=== General

Data file normalization in UnitsDB refers to the process of organizing and
structuring the YAML files that make up the database to ensure consistency,
non-redundancy, and integrity. These rules help maintain the quality and
reliability of the data while facilitating its use in various applications.

=== Normalization principles model

==== Unique identifiers

All model instances within UnitsDB (dimensions, quantities, units, prefixes, etc.) must have unique identifiers. These identifiers follow a consistent pattern:

* Dimensions: `NISTdX` (e.g., `NISTd1`)
* Quantities: `NISTqX` (e.g., `NISTq1`)
* Units: `NISTuX` (e.g., `NISTu1`)
* Prefixes: `NISTpX_Y` (e.g., `NISTp10_3`)

Where `X` and `Y` are numeric values.

==== References

References between entities must use consistent paths:

* References to dimensions use the format `#NISTdX`
* References to quantities use the format `#NISTqX`
* References to units use the format `#NISTuX`

These references create a web of relationships that maintain the integrity of the database.

==== Hierarchical organization

The data is organized in a hierarchical manner that reflects the logical relationship between entities:

* Dimensions provide the mathematical foundation for quantities
* Quantities are physical properties that can be measured
* Units are references for measuring quantities
* Prefixes modify units to create new scales

=== File normalization model

===== dimensions.yaml

* Each dimension entry must have a unique identifier.
* Dimensionless entries must be explicitly marked with `dimensionless: true`.
* Base quantity components must specify their `powerNumerator` and `symbol`.
* When `dim_symbols` are provided, they must include representations in all standard formats (ascii, html, mathml, latex, unicode).

===== quantities.yaml

* Each quantity entry must have a unique identifier.
* Each quantity must reference a valid dimension via `dimension_url`.
* Quantity types must be either `base` or `derived`.
* Quantity names must be provided as an array, with the primary name first.
* Unit references must include both a name and a URL to the unit.

===== units.yaml

* Each unit entry must have a unique identifier.
* Each unit must reference a valid dimension via `dimension_url`.
* The `root` field must be explicitly set to either `true` or `false`.
* If `prefixed` is true, there must be a prefix specified in the `root_units` section.
* Unit names must be provided as an array, with the primary name first.
* Unit symbols must include representations in all standard formats.
* The `unit_system` field must specify both a valid `type` and `name`.
* For derived units, the `root_units` section must properly enumerate all component units with their powers.
* Quantity references must include both a name and a URL to the quantity.

===== prefixes.yaml

* Each prefix entry must have a unique identifier.
* The `base` field must be either 10 (for SI prefixes) or 2 (for binary prefixes).
* The `power` field must be an integer.
* Prefix symbols must include representations in all standard formats.

===== unit_systems.yaml

* Each unit system entry must have a unique identifier.
* The `name` field must be either "SI" or "non-SI".
* The `acceptable` field must be explicitly set to either `true` or `false`.

=== Cross-file normalization model

===== Dimension-quantity relationships

* Each quantity must reference a valid dimension.
* Multiple quantities can reference the same dimension.

===== Quantity-unit relationships

* Each unit must be associated with at least one quantity.
* Multiple units can measure the same quantity.
* The dimension of a unit must match the dimension of the quantities it measures.

===== Unit-prefix relationships

* Prefixed units must reference valid prefixes.
* The same prefix can be applied to multiple units.
* For the base unit of mass (kilogram), prefixes are applied to "gram" rather than "kilogram".

=== Data integrity model

==== General

The data integrity model defines checks and validations that should be performed to ensure the overall consistency and correctness of the UnitsDB database.

[source,lutaml]
----
class DataIntegrityCheck {
  attribute check_type, String {
    definition "Type of integrity check"
  }
  attribute description, String {
    definition "Description of the check"
  }
  attribute severity, String {
    definition "Severity level if check fails (error, warning, info)"
  }
}
----

==== Data integrity checks

To ensure the integrity of the UnitsDB data, the following checks should be performed:

* All reference links must point to valid entities.
* Circular references must be avoided.
* No duplicate identifiers should exist within each entity type.
* Derived dimensions must have consistent exponents in their base quantity components.
* Units must have dimensions that match their referenced quantities.
* All required fields must be present for each entity type.

=== Change management model

==== General

The change management model defines rules and procedures for updating the UnitsDB data files while maintaining backward compatibility and data integrity.

[source,lutaml]
----
class ChangeManagement {
  attribute change_type, String {
    definition "Type of change"
  }
  attribute rules, Array {
    definition "Rules governing this type of change"
  }
  attribute impact, String {
    definition "Potential impact of this type of change"
  }
}
----

==== Versioning and change management

When updating the UnitsDB data files, the following rules should be applied:

* Existing identifier values should not be changed to avoid breaking existing references.
* New entities should be assigned new, unique identifiers.
* When an entity needs to be deprecated, it should be marked as such rather than removed.
* Major structural changes to the data format should be accompanied by a version increment and appropriate documentation.
