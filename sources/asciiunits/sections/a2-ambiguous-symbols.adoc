== Ambiguous unit symbols

The symbols used for units can be highly ambiguous. In order to guarantee accurate parsing,
the symbols used to data enter units are unambiguous in UnitsDB's Units database.

[example]
====
`B` is ambiguous between _bel_ (as in decibel) and _byte_.

These units are kept unambiguous by using `bel_B` and `byte_B` to refer to them,
although they will still both be rendered as `B`.
====

The following table lists ambiguous symbols and how they are disambiguated in the symbol IDs.
