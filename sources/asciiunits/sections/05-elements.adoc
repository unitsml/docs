== Representable elements

=== General

AsciiUnits allows for the encoding of the following types of elements:

* Unit systems
* Units
* Dimensions
* Quantities
* Prefixes in conjunction with units

=== Unit systems

A unit system is a collection of units of measure that forms a coherent
framework for converting between different units of measurement.

UnitsML defines the following unit systems.

.UnitsML unit systems
|===
| ID | Name | Acceptable to be used in the SI system

| `SI_base` | SI | true
| `SI_derived_special` | SI-derived special | true
| `SI_derived_non-special` | SI-derived non-special | true
| `non-SI_acceptable` | non-SI but acceptable to be used together | true
| `non-SI_not_acceptable` | non-SI and unacceptable to be used together | false

|===

Each unit in UnitsML belongs to exactly one unit system.

=== Units

The AsciiUnits syntax is designed to represent a wide range of units of
measurement and their combinations.

It includes:

* Basic units: Simple units and prefixed units

* Composite units: Units formed by combining basic units through mathematical
  operations

Basic units available to AsciiUnits are sourced from UnitsDB.

UnitsDB is a comprehensive database of units of measurement and their relationships, which
is used to define the units and prefixes available in AsciiUnits for various applications.

NOTE: UnitsDB is a part of the UnitsML project and is maintained by CalConnect TC UNITS.

=== Prefixes

A prefix is a modifier to a unit that indicates a fixed factor by which the unit
is multiplied.

Prefixes can be used in conjunction with units to create prefixed units.

The BIPM SI prefixes are used in AsciiUnits, which include the following:

=== Dimensions

A dimension is a physical quantity that can be expressed in terms of
fundamental quantities.

Basic dimensions are described with only one quantity. More complex dimensions
require multiple quantities to be expressed.

Dimensions are represented in AsciiUnits using the `dim_` prefix followed by
the dimension name.

The collection of dimensions is defined in the UnitsDB database.
Each dimension is represented by a unique identifier in the database,
of the pattern `NISTd{n}`.

=== Quantities

A quantity is a type of measurement that is represented by a unit.

Each quantity is associated with one or more quantity names, exactly one
dimension, and one or more units of measurement.

The collection of quantities is defined in the UnitsDB database.
Each quantity is represented by a unique identifier in the database,
of the pattern `NISTq{n}`.
