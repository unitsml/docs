== Formula with units

=== General

AsciiUnits allows for the representation of a formula with units in a variety of
formats, including basic values, mathematical expressions, ranges, intervals,
and uncertainty. This flexibility enables users to express complex measurements
in a clear and concise manner.

=== Formula unit representation

The basic syntax for representing a mathematical expression with a unit.

Syntax:

[source]
----
{text-math-representation} {units-expression}
----

Where,

`{text-math-representation}`:: is a mathematical expression in a supported text
format, such as AsciiMath or UnicodeMath

`{units-expression}`:: is an AsciiUnits expression

----
9.81 m/s^2     # acceleration due to gravity
5.67e-8 W/(m^2*K^4)  # Stefan-Boltzmann constant
299792458 m/s  # speed of light in vacuum
(3.14159 * r^2) m^2     # area of a circle
(1/2 * m * v^2) J       # kinetic energy
(F/m) m/s^2             # acceleration from force and mass
(9.81 * t) m            # distance fallen under gravity after time t
(1/2 * I * Ï‰^2) J       # rotational kinetic energy
