== Introduction

=== General

UnitsML is a suite of technologies that facilitate digital processing of units
of measurement and measurement quantities.

AsciiUnits is a text-based syntax for representing units of measurement in a
compact and human-readable format, designed to be fully compatible with and
interoperable with the UnitsML XML language.

=== Purpose

Key features of AsciiUnits include:

Automatic prefix parsing::
Prefixes attached to unit codes are automatically recognized and processed.

Automatic dimension calculation::
Dimensions are automatically calculated based on the prefixes and units
represented.

Mathematical operations::
Support for mathematical operations on units and dimensions such as addition,
subtraction, division, exponentiation, square root, grouping and parentheses.

Metadata support::
Ability to add additional information such as quantity references, custom
symbols, and names.

UnitsML UnitsDB integration::
The UnitsML UnitsDB database is the basis used by AsciiUnits to define the units
and prefixes available for various applications.


=== Differences with other technologies

==== UCUM

UCUM is a compact coding system for the representation of units of
measurement, primarily designed for electronic data interchange in clinical and
healthcare contexts. Originally developed by the Regenstrief Institute and adopted
by HL7, UCUM is widely used in electronic health records and clinical
information systems.

While AsciiUnits and UCUM (Unified Code for Units of Measure) are both text-based
systems for representing units of measurement, they differ in several key
aspects.

|===
|Feature |AsciiUnits |UCUM

|Syntax approach
|Uses intuitive mathematical operators (`*`, `/`, `^`)
|Uses special characters (`.` for multiplication, `/` for division)

|Readability
|Designed for human readability and ease of typing
|Optimized for compactness and machine processing

|XML integration
|Direct mapping to UnitsML XML
|No built-in XML representation

|Metadata support
|Supports additional metadata (quantity references, custom symbols)
|No metadata support

|Dimensional analysis
|Automatic dimension calculation
|No built-in dimensional analysis

==== QUDT

QUDT (Quantities, Units, Dimensions and Types) is a semantic web framework for
representing quantities, units, dimensions, and types in a consistent and
interoperable manner based on RDF (Resource Description Framework) and OWL (Web
Ontology Language).

QUDT is designed to support the semantic web and linked data applications,
enabling interoperability between different systems and applications.

While AsciiUnits and QUDT share some similarities, they differ in their focus and
implementation.

QUDT relies on RDF and OWL for its representation and does not provide a
text-based syntax for representing units of measurement. AsciiUnits allows for
accessible encoding of units in documents and text files, making it possible for
authors to represent measurement quantities in a clear and concise manner.

AsciiUnits being a text-based syntax, is allows for conversion to and from
UnitsML XML, which is a more structured and machine-readable format. This makes
AsciiUnits suitable for applications where human readability and ease of typing
are important, while QUDT is more focused on semantic web applications.

==== Digital SI framework

The Digital SI framework is an initiative to modernize the International System
of Units (SI) by providing a digital representation of SI units and their
relationships. It aims to enhance the accessibility and usability of SI units in
digital applications, including scientific computing, data analysis, and
machine learning.

The Digital SI framework provides a comprehensive set of tools and resources for
representing SI units, including a digital representation of SI base and derived
units, as well as a set of guidelines for using SI units in digital applications.

While AsciiUnits is designed to be a text-based syntax for representing units of
measurement, the Digital SI framework focuses on providing a digital representation
of SI units and their relationships. AsciiUnits can be used in conjunction with
the Digital SI framework to provide a human-readable representation of SI units
and their relationships, making it easier for users to work with SI units in
digital applications.

==== Other technologies

AsciiUnits is designed to be compatible with and interoperable with other
technologies for representing units of measurement, including UCUM, QUDT, and the
Digital SI framework. It can be used in conjunction with these technologies to
provide a comprehensive solution for representing units of measurement in
scientific and engineering applications.
