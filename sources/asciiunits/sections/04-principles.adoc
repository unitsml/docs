== Principles

AsciiUnits follows the following key principles to ensure clarity and usability
in representing units.

Typability:: Symbols are meant to be easily typed on standard keyboards,
avoiding complex characters or symbols.

Non-ambiguous:: Unit representation and composure syntax should lead to exactly
one interpretation, ensuring that each expression has an unambiguous meaning.

Extensible:: New units and new prefixes can be added to the system without
changing the syntax.
