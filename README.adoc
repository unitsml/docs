== Introduction

This repository contains the official documentation for UnitsML (Units Markup
Language), a comprehensive suite of technologies that facilitate digital
processing of units of measurement and measurement quantities.

UnitsML is a technology suite for working with units of measure. It provides a
standardized way to represent units, quantities, dimensions, and prefixes,
enabling unambiguous storage, exchange, and processing of numerical data across
different systems and domains.

The documentation includes:

AsciiUnits syntax specification::
A text-based syntax for representing units of measurement in a compact and human-readable format, fully compatible and interoperable with the UnitsML XML language

UnitsML guide::
Guidelines for using UnitsML in various applications

UnitsML guide to incorporating UnitsML XML::
Methods for incorporating UnitsML into other markup languages

UnitsML subset specification for embedding into UBL NDR::
Specification for UnitsML in the context of Universal Business Language Naming and Design Rules

== Building the documentation

This repository uses Metanorma to build standardized documentation.

=== Installing build tools

See https://www.metanorma.org/install/ for detailed installation instructions.

=== Building locally

If you have Metanorma installed locally, run:

[source,sh]
----
metanorma site generate
----

=== Building with Docker

If you prefer using Docker, run:

[source,sh]
----
docker run -v "$(pwd)":/metanorma -w /metanorma -it metanorma/mn metanorma site generate
----

== Generated formats

The build process generates documentation in multiple formats:

* HTML -- Web-friendly format with navigation
* PDF -- Print-ready format
* XML -- Machine-readable format
